      <div>A wand is a magical object through which a wizard/witch channels his/her magical powers. Most spells are done with the aid of a wand, even though it is possible to perform magic without one</div>
      <div>Materials: Most wands were long, thin rods of wood with a magical substance embedded into their core.</div>
      <div>Magical Substances: There are others, but these are the main three
        1. Unicorn Hair : Unicorn hair generally produced the most consistent magic
        2. Dragon Heartstring: As a rule, dragon heartstrings produced wands with the most power, and which were capable of the most flamboyant spells 
        3. Phoenix Feather: Rarest, capable of the widest range of magic
